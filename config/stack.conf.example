# VR Stack configuration (bash-sourced)

# --- Tracking / body tracking app ---
# Examples:
#   TRACK_CMD="/opt/slimevr/slimevr"
#   TRACK_CMD="mytracker --flags"
#   TRACK_CMD=""     # empty = skip tracking app
TRACK_CMD="/opt/slimevr/slimevr"

# Pattern that indicates tracking backend is ready (used for wait-for-ready)
# SlimeVR example:
TRACK_READY_PGREP="slimevr\.jar"

# --- Server component ---
SERVER_CMD="wivrn-server"
SERVER_PGREP="wivrn-server"

# --- VR app (OpenXR client) ---
VR_CMD="wayvr"
VR_PGREP="(^|/)(wayvr)(\\s|$)"

# --- OpenXR runtime pin ---
# Keep this unless you intentionally change your OpenXR runtime.
